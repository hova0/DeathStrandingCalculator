# DeathStrandingCalculator

Provides three features for use with Death Stranding.

1. Road Repair:  Enter the _current_ durability left on a road, and it'll tell you what you need to repair it.   Defaults to metal as the repair material.
2. Road Building:  Plug in Contributions (0 if off-network) and the Total needed, and this will let you know what you need to build the road.  Press enter to have the numbers update.
3. Ad-Hoc:  If you want to just know how much a certain amount of material divides up into, you can do it here.   For example, if you need 1440 of Chemicals, it'll spit out 600, 600, and 240 as the containers you need to pull.
